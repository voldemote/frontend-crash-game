            Live Events are a new kind of entertainment: You can watch live
            sports, funny and serious events and bet on the outcome of the
            stream.
          </p>

          <p>
            You simply choose an event, enter how much you want to trade and
            select between 2-4 outcomes and see how much return you make. You
            can place a bet in seconds from any where.That simple it is.
          </p>

          <p>
            Btw, you can “sell” your positions at any time, When the propability
            of your choice has gone up, you can sell any time before the event
            ends at a profit.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also, you can share, chat, see event details, trading history and
            your open positions.

            On the journey to Mars, the value of {TOKEN_NAME} tokens increases
            and you can (and should) cash out your position any time on the
            journey. But don’t wait too long, at some point the rocket crashes
            and the {TOKEN_NAME} tokens that are still in the rocket crash with
            it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Elon is known for a good surprise, so you might come across NFT
            rewards and special gifts at any future time.
