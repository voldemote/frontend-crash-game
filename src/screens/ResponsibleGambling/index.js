          <h2>Responsible Gambling and Self Exclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Gambling means for many of our users, entertainment, fun and excitement. But we also know that for some of our users, gambling has negative side effects.
            Gambling can be addictive and we encourage you to play responsibly and only with the money you can afford to lose.<br />
            Since many years, the medical field has recognized pathologic gambling as a serious sickness. To make sure you enjoy our games in a responsible and entertaining manner we provided self-exclusion.<br />
            We therefore take Responsible Gambling very seriously and try our best to help.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under “Responsible Gambling” We provide multiple steps or measures, with which We can help our users to lower the possibility of negative side effects appearing. In case they already appear We also try to take active steps against them. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The most important instrument against negative side effects from gambling are knowledge and education about the risks of gambling. In order to support our user's self-control and to make sure they do not suffer from negative side effects, We wish to provide You with the following:

          <h2>Self-Exclusion and Time Out:</h2>
          <p>
            Should You be diagnosed with a gambling addiction or have the need to stay away from gambling for a different reason, We want to assist You to stay away from anything, that is not in Your best interest. Self-Exclusion and Time Out practices allow You to take some time off and away from gambling on Alpacasino. You can determine the period and/or duration of time You wish to remain absent from Alpacasino. During Your chosen period of time, access to Your Alpacasino Account will be blocked. <br />
            “Self-Exclusion” means, that You exclude Yourself, out of Your own choice, from all gambling Services. This exclusion cannot be undone for a set amount of time.<br/>
            In order to activate this period of Self Exclusion or Time Out, we request You to kindly contact Our customer support via email: <a href={"mailto: support@alpacasino.io"}>support@alpacasino.io</a>

          </p>
          <p>
            During Self Exclusion You are not allowed to create a new Account and every attempt to create a new Account during Self Exclusion is a violation of our Terms of Service and may result in the permanent ban of Your original Account.
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as Your selected Self-Exclusion period has come to an end, Your Account will automatically be reopened. However, You will receive an email confirmation of this information which will be sent to Your registered email address.
