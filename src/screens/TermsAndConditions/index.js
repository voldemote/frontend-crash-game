                If any term, clause or provision of these Terms &amp; Conditions
                is held unlawful, void or unenforceable, then that term, clause
                or provision will be severable from these Terms &amp; Conditions
                and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any
                remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other
                term, clause or provision of these Terms &amp; Conditions. In
                the case of a clause not being valid or in the case that a
                regulation has not been included therein, this gap shall be
                replaced by a valid clause that the Parties would have been
                agreed upon if they would have known the gap.
